## 🎨 Front-End Developer & Designer

I’m a **Front-End Developer** from **Russia**, passionate about creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces. My focus is on blending design with code — crafting intuitive experiences that are not just functional, but beautiful.

Whether I’m working with code or collaborating on design systems, I care deeply about detail, usability, and performance.
